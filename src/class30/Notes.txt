Set:

    Sets do not allow duplicate values.There are three main types of sets :

1-HashSet 2-LinkedHashSet 3-TreeSet

1-HashSet(most widely used):
  Upside: Speed it's the fastest
  Downside: It does not maintain the insertion order.
2-LinkedHashSet:
  Upside: maintains the insertion order.
  Downside: Slower than HashSet.
3-TreeSet:
  Upside: keeps the data sorted.
  Downside: it is slower than all.

  Map:
  Map is not a part of collection framework ,but it does the same function but instead of inserting one element
  we can insert two elements, Map is an interface (see diagram).

  Maps allow us to store data in the form of key value pairs.Just like Sets we have three main types of maps as well
  for example: 1-HashMap 2-LinkedHashMap 3-TreeMap ( These types of maps function 100 percent like other Sets)

1-HashMap(most widely used):
  Upside: Speed it's the fastest
  Downside: It does not maintain the insertion order.
2-LinkedHashMap:
  Upside: maintains the insertion order.
  Downside: Slower than HashSet.
3-TreeMap:
  Upside: keeps the data sorted.
  Downside: it is slower than all.

  ====> Only difference is instead of storing one element we can store 2 elements. And Map is not a part of collection framework
