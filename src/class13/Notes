When we should use String Class:
    when we want to save as much as memory as possible and we are ok if the programs get a little slow.

 When should we use StringBuilder Class:
 when we want maximum speed and we do not care how much memory our programs going to occupy.
 what does it mean by String immutable:
 It means Strings are not changeable once created in the memory of the computer, and the reason they are immutable is that
 same memory cell can be shared across many variables and if we allow any of the variable to change
  the value it can break the complete system
