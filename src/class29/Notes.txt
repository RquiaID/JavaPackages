Loops are not good to use with ArrayList and LinkedList because they are not good with changing the size of ArrayList.
Also since they are static they can not adapt to size change.

Iterator:

Sets like HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet don't allow duplicate values.There are three main types of Sets.

 HashSet:
  Upside:Fast.
  Downside:Does not retain the insertion order.

LinkedHashSet:
 Upside:Retains the insertion order.
 Downside: it is slower than HashSet.

TreeSet:
 Upside: it keeps the data sorted
 Downside: it is the slowest
