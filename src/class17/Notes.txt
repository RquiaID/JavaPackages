Access Modifiers:

   =>Is a mechanism through which we can control which variables should be accessed within  the class or outside the class,

   but in the same package or anywhere inside package. It controls there visibility.

  =>These modifiers control the accessibility of instance or static fields, methods and classes.

  =>Be careful we can not use these access modifiers with local variables.

  => There are four access levels and there are three access modifier keywords.

  1) private is the most restricted one 2)default this one is not actually a keyword 3)protected 4)public

  => How do I make something default? if I don't use any keyword at all,the default is automatically applied.

  => Instance methods the one who don't have static keyword.
  => Static means one value at a time.

 Constructors:

    Constructors in Java help us create objects easily or initialize the instance fields of a class in a better way.

 Rules:

   1) They are similar to methods, but they don't have return types.
   2) They have same name as class name.
   3) We can use all the access modifiers with the constructors.
   4) static keyword is not allowed with constructors.

   // we can create multiples constructors by creating multiple parameters
