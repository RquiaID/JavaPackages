OOP(Object oriented programming):
   It is just a way of writing code that follows certain rules or guidelines.We create classes that have attributes/
   properties/fields and methods/function/behaviourism.

   Why we should learn OOP?
   1) It simplifies the software development(process of building the software)
    and maintenance(adding new features changing the existing code).
   2) Code duplication is reduced.
   3)Is also helps ur represent something from real life with the help of the class and objects.
   Class:
    is a blueprint or design from which actual real life objects are created. Computer uses a class to check what that
    class can do:
    Scanner scan=Scanner(System.in)=> here Scanner is a class and scan is an object of Scanner class. with the help of
    object we can use methods from a class we can also use properties from that class.
   Object:
Note:
inside a class sequence does not matter
