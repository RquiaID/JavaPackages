Method Overloading:

    It is a mechanism in java that allows us to have same method name with different parameters.
    Parameters can be different in number,type, or sequence.

Why we should overload a method?

   1) Method overloading allows us to reuse same method name again and again that we don't have to come up with different
    method names if we are doing the same operation  again and again.

   2) It allows us to write clean code.

How to overload a method:
    We can overload a method by redefining it with different parameters.

Method Overriding:

  It's a mechanism in java that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of method.

Why we should override a method?

 If a child class does not like the implementation of the parent class it has the flexibility that it can override that method.


Syntax of override?

    There must a parent child relationship between two classes.


Rules:

    1) To override a method there must be parent child relationship between two classes.
    2) If something can not be inherited we can't override it. For example private methods and constructors.
    3) This override only used with methods
    4) The visibility of a method can be increased for example if something has default access or protected access
    we can make it public, but we can not decrease it
