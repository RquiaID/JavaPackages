Super keyword:

Is used to refer to the parent class members like fields methods and constructors.

When we should use Super or this keyword:

   Whenever same name field or method exists inside the parent and child class. we can use super
   keyword to explicitly refer to parent class variables methods or constructors.

Note:

   By default, Java prefers local variables if they don't exist (if it can not find it
   looks for instance variable from same class after that the instance variables or methods from the parent class).

Method overloading:

   Method overloading happens when same name method exists in a class with different parameters. We can overload methods in 3 different
   ways:

   1)By changing the number of parameters.
   2)By changing the date types.
   3)By changing the sequence of parameters.

Why should we overload a method or constructor?

   Clean code and flexibility to end user.


Some important classes:

 if else conditions
 loops
 arrays methods
 String class methods
 inheritance
